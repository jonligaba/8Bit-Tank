# 8Bit-Tank

Semester long project: Android application game between two tanks battling it out. The application is a real-time strategy game
that involves two players shooting at each other. The players are connected via bluetooth connection. 

The idea came from the popular game called "Gunbound". The game was a turn-base multiplayer that allows you to shoot three different
types of missiles at each other. Originally, the group planned for an 8Bit graphics but we ended up finishing the application with better
graphics and sticking with the original game name we came up with during our first group meeting.
